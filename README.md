# Help me find a place to live in berlin!


Hallo!

My name is Nicole and I am looking for a flat or flatshare in Berlin! I made this website to make it easier for potential landlords and flatmates to get a better understanding of who I am. Also it is apparently incredibly difficult to find a place to live as a foriegner in Berlin supposedly, so I am doing what I do best: making a website.


# About Me

* I am in my mid-twenties.
* I am a quiet, respectful person.
* I do not smoke. I do not have pets.
* I am from the United States.
* I speak English and Spanish.
* I am an avid traveler. I have spent the past few years traveling around the Americas and Europe. I am very on-the-go and love to learn about new food, cultures, countries and useless facts.
* Non-vegetarian/vegan. I eat and cook meat.

## How I spend my time

* I am a professional web developer. I have about 11 years of coding experience and 8 years of professional working experience.
* I work as a freelancer/contractor for clients and projects.
* I work remotely -- so this means I work from home, cafes, libraries and coworking spaces.
* I will be enrolled in university online starting in January. So most of my time will be spent working, studying and learning German.


## Hobbies and Goals
* I am excited to live abroad and explore Germany.
* I would like to get into more creative hobbies, like sewing and knitting.
* I would like to start becoming fluent in German.
* I am excited to discover the Berlin Technology and Design scene.


## What I am looking for

* I would like a long term WG, provided that I am approved for the visa.
* I need an Amendulng
* I love old style flats with high ceilings, hardwood floors and big windows OPTIONAL
* Ideally I would prefer to live in Prenzlauer Berg. But I am open to Mitte, Schoenberg, Kreuzberg,
* Room can be furnished or unfurnished.
* I have a flexible and open time frame. I would be interested in anything opening in November, December or January. I will be available for viewings in November and December.


## Me as a flatmate
* I try to be minimalist. I have lived with only a suitcase for the majority of the last 2 years. I try to only purchase and acquire things I need.
* I am pretty quiet, you probably won't even notice I'm home.
* I am respectful of other's belongings and personal space.
* I will probably cook. I am trying to eat healthier, I am trying to do weekly meal planning (preparing meals in advance).
* I am easygoing and friendly.


# What I can provide
* Work contracts, to prove I will have income
* Recent pay slips/invoices, as proof of income
* Identification/passport
* Deposit
* Timely rent payments via bank transfer
